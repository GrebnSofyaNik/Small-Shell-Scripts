Working with shell scripts

## Description edit.sh.
***== The src/edit.sh script was created to replace substrings in text files. As input, it must take the path to the file (relative to the root directory), the replacement string, and the replacement itself (as a string). Information about each file change should be logged in the src/files.log in the following format: file path - file size in bytes - date and time - sha-sum of the file - sha calculation algorithm. ==***
